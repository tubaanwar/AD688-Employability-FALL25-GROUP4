##  Project Overview  
We analyze how the fields of *business analytics, data science, and machine learning* are evolving in 2024 from the vantage point of job seekers. Our aim is to uncover:  
1. The *most in-demand skills* in these domains  
2. Whether *job descriptions have shifted* to require AI/ML expertise  
3. Which *industries are hiring data scientists* (and why)  
4. The *career outlook* for business analytics professionals  

Using Lightcast data (and complementary external sources), we will build visualizations and dashboards to surface trends and actionable insights. The final deliverable is a Quarto-based website published on GitHub Pages.

##  Why This Matters  
The intersection of data analytics and AI is reshaping industries across every sector. As organizations become more data-driven, demand for talent who can translate data into strategy, build predictive models, and deploy machine learning is rising. For students and job seekers, understanding which skills and industries are most dynamic helps in *making career decisions, targeting training, and differentiating oneself* in a competitive job market.

Furthermore, with AI, generative models, and automation gaining traction, the roles of data professionals are becoming more specialized (e.g., ML engineer, AI product manager, analytics translator). Tracking how these shifts manifest in real job postings will help future professionals anticipate where the field is heading.
