    "text": "This research explores the evolving landscape of Business Analytics, Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) careers in 2024. As organizations increasingly integrate AI in every function from operations to strategic decision-making, the demand for professionals with strong data and analytics skills is growing rapidly. This study explores four interconnected questions: the most sought-after skills for analytics and ML roles, how job descriptions are changing to require AI literacy, which industries are leading data-driven hiring, and what the short- to medium-term career outlook looks like for analytics professionals. By combining insights from labor market data and recent academic research, this project provides a holistic view of how AI and automation are transforming workforce expectations and employability strategies for students and professionals."
