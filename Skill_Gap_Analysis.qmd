## 1. Team Skill Assessment

### 1.1 Creating Team Skills Profile

Each team member rates their proficiency in key IT skills on a scale of 1-5:
- **1** = Beginner (aware of the skill)
- **2** = Basic knowledge (can perform simple tasks)
- **3** = Intermediate (comfortable with common scenarios)
- **4** = Advanced (can handle complex problems)
- **5** = Expert (can teach others and solve any problem)

```{python}
# Team member skill assessments
# TODO: Replace with actual team member names and skill ratings
skills_data = {
    "Name": ["Tuba Anwar", "Kriti Singh", "Soham Deshkhaire"],
    "Python": [4, 3, 4],
    "SQL": [3, 4, 3],
    "Machine Learning": [3, 2, 4],
    "Data Analysis": [4, 4, 3],
    "Cloud Computing": [2, 2, 3],
    "Java": [3, 2, 2],
    "JavaScript": [2, 3, 3],
    "R": [3, 3, 2],
    "Tableau": [3, 4, 2],
    "Excel": [4, 5, 3],
    "AWS": [2, 1, 2],
    "Azure": [1, 2, 2],
    "Docker": [2, 1, 3],
    "Git": [3, 3, 4],
    "Power BI": [2, 3, 2],
    "Spark": [2, 2, 3],
    "TensorFlow": [2, 1, 3],
    "NLP": [3, 2, 3]
}

df_team_skills = pd.DataFrame(skills_data)
df_team_skills.set_index("Name", inplace=True)

# Display team skills
#print("Team Skills Profile:")
#print(df_team_skills)

# Calculate team averages
team_avg = df_team_skills.mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
#print(f"\nTeam Average Skills (sorted):")
#print(team_avg)
```

The team’s strongest skills are *Excel, Python, and Data Analysis, showing solid readiness for analytical and data-focused roles. Skills like **SQL, Git, Tableau, and Machine Learning* are moderately strong, indicating reliable but improvable proficiency. Meanwhile, areas such as *AWS, Azure, TensorFlow, Docker, and Cloud Computing* show lower scores, highlighting clear opportunities for growth—especially important given rising market demand for cloud and ML engineering skills. Overall, the team has a strong analytical foundation but should focus on boosting cloud and advanced technical competencies to stay competitive.

### 1.2 Team Skills Heatmap

Visualize each team member's strengths and weaknesses across all skills.

```{python}
# Create heatmap using hvPlot
heatmap = df_team_skills.T.hvplot.heatmap(
    title='Team Skill Proficiency Heatmap',
    cmap='RdYlGn',
    height=700,
    width=800,
    xlabel='Team Member',
    ylabel='Skill',
    clabel='Proficiency Level',
    rot=0
)
heatmap
```

This heatmap shows how strong each team member is across key tech skills like AWS, Excel, SQL, Machine Learning, and more. The greener the box, the stronger the skill—red means the weakest. From a job seeker’s perspective, this quickly highlights which skills are common strengths and which ones need improvement to stay competitive. For example, Excel, Data Analysis, and SQL show strong proficiency across the team, meaning these are essential, in-demand skills worth mastering. Meanwhile, AWS and JavaScript show weaker proficiency, signaling great opportunities for upskilling—especially since cloud and coding skills are highly valued in today’s market.

### 1.3 Team Average Skills Bar Chart

Compare team average proficiency across all skills.

```{python}
# Prepare data for bar chart
team_avg_df = team_avg.reset_index()
team_avg_df.columns = ['Skill', 'Average Proficiency']

# Create bar chart
chart = team_avg_df.sort_values('Average Proficiency', ascending=True).hvplot.barh(
    x='Skill',
    y='Average Proficiency',
    title='Team Average Skill Proficiency',
    height=700,
    width=900,
    color='#3498db',
    xlabel='Average Proficiency (1-5)',
    ylabel='',
    flip_yaxis=True
)
chart
```
The team’s top 10 skills show strong proficiency in high-value areas like *Excel, Data Analysis, Python, Git, and SQL, which are core requirements for most analytics and tech roles. Mid-level strengths in **Machine Learning, Tableau, R, and JavaScript* show the team can handle more advanced tasks but still has room to grow. Overall, these skills place the team in a competitive position for data and tech jobs, while highlighting opportunities to strengthen cloud and AI-related tools for even better market readiness.

## 2. Market Skill Demand Analysis

### 2.1 Extracting Skills from Job Descriptions

We analyze job postings to identify the most in-demand skills in the IT job market.

```{python}
# Define comprehensive skill keywords to search for
skill_keywords = {
    'Python': ['python', 'python3', 'py'],
    'SQL': ['sql', 'mysql', 'postgresql', 'sql server', 'oracle sql'],
    'Machine Learning': ['machine learning', 'ml', 'deep learning', 'neural network'],
    'Data Analysis': ['data analysis', 'data analytics', 'analytical'],
    'Cloud Computing': ['cloud', 'cloud computing', 'cloud services'],
    'Java': ['java', 'java8', 'java 8'],
    'JavaScript': ['javascript', 'js', 'node.js', 'nodejs'],
    'R': [' r ', 'r programming', 'rstudio'],
    'Tableau': ['tableau'],
    'Excel': ['excel', 'microsoft excel', 'advanced excel'],
    'AWS': ['aws', 'amazon web services', 'ec2', 's3'],
    'Azure': ['azure', 'microsoft azure'],
    'Docker': ['docker', 'containerization'],
    'Git': ['git', 'github', 'version control'],
    'Power BI': ['power bi', 'powerbi'],
    'Spark': ['spark', 'apache spark', 'pyspark'],
    'TensorFlow': ['tensorflow', 'tf'],
    'NLP': ['nlp', 'natural language processing', 'text mining']
}

# Function to extract skills from text
def extract_skills(text):
    if pd.isna(text):
        return []
    text = str(text).lower()
    found_skills = []
    for skill, keywords in skill_keywords.items():
        for keyword in keywords:
            if keyword in text:
                found_skills.append(skill)
                break
    return found_skills

# Extract skills from job titles and descriptions (if available)
if 'TITLE_NAME' in df.columns:
    df['extracted_skills'] = df['TITLE_NAME'].apply(extract_skills)
    
    # If job description available, combine with title
    if 'DESCRIPTION' in df.columns or 'JOB_DESCRIPTION' in df.columns:
        desc_col = 'DESCRIPTION' if 'DESCRIPTION' in df.columns else 'JOB_DESCRIPTION'
        df['extracted_skills'] = df.apply(
            lambda row: list(set(extract_skills(row['TITLE_NAME']) + extract_skills(row[desc_col]))),
            axis=1
        )

# Count skill occurrences
all_skills = [skill for skills_list in df['extracted_skills'] for skill in skills_list]
skill_counts = Counter(all_skills)
market_skills_df = pd.DataFrame(skill_counts.items(), columns=['Skill', 'Job Postings'])
market_skills_df = market_skills_df.sort_values('Job Postings', ascending=False)
market_skills_df['Percentage'] = (market_skills_df['Job Postings'] / len(df) * 100).round(2)

#print("Market Skill Demand (Top Skills):")
#print(market_skills_df.head(10))
```

The skill extraction shows that *Data Analysis, **Cloud Computing, and **TensorFlow* are the most frequently requested skills in job postings, making them top priorities for job seekers. Technical fundamentals like *Git, **SQL, and **Azure* also appear often, highlighting the importance of both data-related and cloud skills. Lower-frequency skills such as *Spark* or *AWS* still matter but are requested less often, suggesting they may serve as valuable “bonus” skills rather than core requirements.

### 2.2 Top In-Demand Skills Visualization

```{python}
# Create bar chart of top 10 market skills
top_market_skills = market_skills_df.head(10).sort_values('Job Postings', ascending=True)

chart = top_market_skills.hvplot.barh(
    x='Skill',
    y='Job Postings',
    title='Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills in Job Market (2024)',
    height=600,
    width=900,
    color='#3498db',
    hover_cols=['Percentage'],
    xlabel='Number of Job Postings Requiring Skill',
    ylabel='',
    flip_yaxis=True
)
chart
```

The chart shows that *Data Analysis* and *Cloud Computing* are the most in-demand skills in the 2024 job market, with far more postings than any other skill. This means employers are strongly prioritizing candidates who can analyze data and work with cloud platforms. Skills like *TensorFlow, Git, SQL, Azure, and **Java* are also highly requested, making them great additions to your skillset. Lower-demand skills such as *Spark, AWS, Tableau, and **Machine Learning* still matter, but they won’t give as much of a competitive edge as the top skills.

## 3. Skill Gap Identification

### 3.1 Comparing Team Skills to Market Demand

Now we identify gaps between our team's capabilities and what the market requires.

```{python}
# Normalize market demand to 1-5 scale for comparison
# We'll scale based on percentage of jobs requiring each skill
max_percentage = market_skills_df['Percentage'].max()

# Create comparison dataframe
comparison_data = []

for skill in df_team_skills.columns:
    team_avg_skill = team_avg[skill]
    
    # Get market demand (normalized to 1-5 scale)
    if skill in market_skills_df['Skill'].values:
        market_pct = market_skills_df[market_skills_df['Skill'] == skill]['Percentage'].values[0]
        market_demand = (market_pct / max_percentage) * 5  # Scale to 1-5
    else:
        market_demand = 0
    
    gap = market_demand - team_avg_skill
    
    comparison_data.append({
        'Skill': skill,
        'Team Average': team_avg_skill,
        'Market Demand': market_demand,
        'Gap': gap,
        'Gap_Category': 'Strength' if gap <= 0 else ('Moderate Gap' if gap <= 2 else 'Critical Gap')
    })

comparison_df = pd.DataFrame(comparison_data)
comparison_df = comparison_df.sort_values('Gap', ascending=False)

#print("Skill Gap Analysis:")
#print(comparison_df)
```

The analysis shows that our team is *strong in most core skills, especially Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, and Git — all areas where market demand is relatively low to moderate. However, there are **two skills with clear gaps* compared to what employers want:

* *Cloud Computing* (e.g., AWS, Azure)
* *Data Analysis*

These areas are in *very high demand*, but our team’s proficiency is lower than what the job market expects. Strengthening Cloud tools and advanced Data Analysis techniques would significantly boost job readiness and competitiveness in today’s tech hiring landscape.

### 3.2 Skill Gap Visualization

```{python}
# Create comparison dataframe for visualization
comparison_melted = comparison_df.melt(
    id_vars='Skill',
    value_vars=['Team Average', 'Market Demand'],
    var_name='Metric',
    value_name='Level'
)

# Sort by Market Demand
skill_order = comparison_df.sort_values('Market Demand', ascending=False)['Skill'].tolist()

# Create grouped bar chart
chart = comparison_melted.hvplot.bar(
    x='Skill',
    y='Level',
    by='Metric',
    title='Team Skills vs Market Demand Comparison',
    height=600,
    width=1000,
    ylabel='Proficiency / Demand Level (1-5)',
    xlabel='Skill',
    legend='top_right',
    rot=45
)
chart
```

The chart clearly shows that *market demand is much higher than the team’s current skill levels across nearly all skills. The biggest gaps appear in **Cloud Computing, Data Analysis, TensorFlow, Azure, and AWS, meaning these are the most urgent areas for development. Skills like **Git, SQL, Python, and Machine Learning* are team strengths, but still trail behind what employers expect.

For job seekers like us, this means focusing on cloud technologies, advanced analytics, and AI frameworks will significantly boost competitiveness and align better with real market needs.

### 3.3 Skill Gap Priority Matrix

Identify which skills need immediate attention based on gap size.

```{python}
# Create scatter plot: Team proficiency vs Market demand
chart = comparison_df.hvplot.scatter(
    x='Team Average',
    y='Market Demand',
    by='Gap_Category',
    size=abs(comparison_df['Gap']) * 50,
    hover_cols=['Skill', 'Gap'],
    title='Skill Gap Priority Matrix',
    height=700,
    width=900,
    xlabel='Team Average Proficiency (1-5)',
    ylabel='Market Demand Level (1-5 normalized)',
    legend='top_left',
    color=['#2ecc71', '#f39c12', '#e74c3c']
)
chart
```

The matrix helps identify which skills your team should focus on first.

* *Green (Moderate Gap):* These skills—like Cloud Computing, Data Analysis, and TensorFlow—are *high in market demand but lower in team proficiency*, meaning they should be top priority for upskilling.
* *Orange (Strength):* Most other skills fall in this category. These are areas where the team is already strong compared to market demand—great to maintain but not urgent for improvement.


## 4. Individual Skill Gap Analysis

### 4.1 Skill Gaps by Team Member

Identify personalized skill development needs for each team member.

```{python}
# Calculate individual gaps
individual_gaps = []

for member in df_team_skills.index:
    for skill in df_team_skills.columns:
        member_skill = df_team_skills.loc[member, skill]
        
        # Get market demand
        if skill in market_skills_df['Skill'].values:
            market_pct = market_skills_df[market_skills_df['Skill'] == skill]['Percentage'].values[0]
            market_demand = (market_pct / max_percentage) * 5
        else:
            market_demand = 0
        
        gap = market_demand - member_skill
        
        if gap > 0:  # Only include gaps (areas for improvement)
            individual_gaps.append({
                'Member': member,
                'Skill': skill,
                'Current Level': member_skill,
                'Market Demand': market_demand,
                'Gap': gap
            })

individual_gaps_df = pd.DataFrame(individual_gaps)
individual_gaps_df = individual_gaps_df.sort_values(['Member', 'Gap'], ascending=[True, False])

# Show top 5 gaps per member
#print("Top 5 Skill Gaps per Team Member:")
for member in df_team_skills.index:
    #print(f"\n{member}:")
    member_gaps = individual_gaps_df[individual_gaps_df['Member'] == member].head(5)
    #print(member_gaps[['Skill', 'Current Level', 'Gap']].to_string(index=False))
```

ach team member has two main skill gaps: Cloud Computing and Data Analysis.

Tuba Anwar needs improvement mainly in Cloud Computing, with a smaller gap in Data Analysis.

Kriti Singh also shows the same pattern—Cloud Computing is the biggest gap, followed by Data Analysis.

Soham Deshkhaires has the highest gap in Data Analysis, and a moderate gap in Cloud Computing.

Overall Insight:
All three team members share the same critical areas for improvement. Strengthening Cloud Computing and Data Analysis should be the top priority for the team.

### 4.2 Individual Gap Visualization

```{python}
# Get top 5 gaps per member
top_individual_gaps = individual_gaps_df.groupby('Member').head(5)

# Create bar chart for each member
for member in df_team_skills.index:
    member_data = top_individual_gaps[top_individual_gaps['Member'] == member].sort_values('Gap', ascending=True)
    
    plot = member_data.hvplot.barh(
        x='Skill',
        y='Gap',
        title=f'Top 5 Skill Gaps - {member}',
        height=400,
        width=700,
        color='#e74c3c',
        xlabel='Skill Gap (Market - Current)',
        ylabel='',
        flip_yaxis=True
    )
    
    display(plot)
```

Across all three members—Tuba, Kriti, and Soham—the largest skill gap is in Cloud Computing, meaning the market demands this skill at a much higher level than the team currently possesses. This makes Cloud Computing the top priority area for improvement for everyone.

Additionally, Data Analysis appears as a major gap for both Tuba and Kriti, while Soham shows a moderate gap in Cloud Computing only. This indicates that although the team already has some analytical skills, the job market expects a stronger command in this area.

The charts highlight two urgent development needs for the team:

Cloud Computing → biggest gap for all members

Data Analysis → second-highest gap for Tuba & Kriti

Focusing training efforts on these skills will significantly improve alignment with market expectations.individual

## 5. Skill Development Plan

### 5.1 Priority Skills for Team Development

Based on our analysis, here are the priority skills the team should focus on:

```{python}
# Identify critical gaps (gap > 2)
critical_gaps = comparison_df[comparison_df['Gap'] > 2].sort_values('Gap', ascending=False)

#print("CRITICAL SKILLS TO DEVELOP (Gap > 2):")
#print(critical_gaps[['Skill', 'Team Average', 'Market Demand', 'Gap']])

# Identify moderate gaps (1 < gap <= 2)
moderate_gaps = comparison_df[(comparison_df['Gap'] > 1) & (comparison_df['Gap'] <= 2)].sort_values('Gap', ascending=False)

#print("\n\nMODERATE PRIORITY SKILLS (1 < Gap <= 2):")
#print(moderate_gaps[['Skill', 'Team Average', 'Market Demand', 'Gap']])
```

The analysis shows that the team has *no critical skill gaps, meaning no skill is urgently below market expectations. However, two areas — **Cloud Computing* and *Data Analysis* — fall into the *moderate-priority* category. These skills have higher market demand than the team’s current proficiency levels, making them important for upskilling. Focusing on these areas will help the team stay competitive, align with industry expectations, and strengthen overall technical capability.

```{python}
# Create learning recommendations
learning_resources = {
    'Python': {
        'Courses': ['Python for Data Science (Coursera)', 'Complete Python Bootcamp (Udemy)'],
        'Practice': ['LeetCode Python problems', 'HackerRank Python track'],
        'Time': '2-3 months for intermediate proficiency'
    },
    'SQL': {
        'Courses': ['SQL for Data Science (Coursera)', 'The Complete SQL Bootcamp (Udemy)'],
        'Practice': ['SQLZoo', 'LeetCode Database problems'],
        'Time': '1-2 months'
    },
    'Machine Learning': {
        'Courses': ['Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Coursera)', 'Fast.ai Practical Deep Learning'],
        'Practice': ['Kaggle competitions', 'Personal ML projects'],
        'Time': '3-6 months'
    },
    'AWS': {
        'Courses': ['AWS Certified Solutions Architect (A Cloud Guru)', 'AWS Free Tier hands-on'],
        'Practice': ['Build personal projects on AWS', 'AWS Cloud Quest'],
        'Time': '2-3 months'
    },
    'Docker': {
        'Courses': ['Docker Mastery (Udemy)', 'Docker documentation'],
        'Practice': ['Containerize personal projects', 'Docker Hub'],
        'Time': '1-2 months'
    },
    'Cloud Computing': {
        'Courses': ['Cloud Computing Concepts (Coursera)', 'Google Cloud Training'],
        'Practice': ['Multi-cloud projects', 'Free tier experimentation'],
        'Time': '2-4 months'
    }
}
        
```

### 5.3 Team Collaboration Strategy

How can team members help each other?

```{python}
# Identify team strengths (where team exceeds market demand)
team_strengths = comparison_df[comparison_df['Gap'] < 0].sort_values('Team Average', ascending=False)

#print("TEAM STRENGTHS (Can mentor others):")
#print(team_strengths[['Skill', 'Team Average', 'Market Demand']])

# Create mentoring pairs based on individual strengths
#print("\n\nSUGGESTED MENTORING OPPORTUNITIES:")

```

The team collaboration strategy highlights how members can support one another by leveraging individual strengths to address skill gaps. Team strengths such as Excel, Python, SQL, Git, Tableau, Machine Learning, JavaScript, NLP, R, Spark, Power BI, Java, TensorFlow, Docker, Azure, and AWS show which members have above-average proficiency and can mentor others. Suggested mentoring pathways include: Soham Deshkhaire (Level 4) mentoring Kriti Singh (Level 2) in Machine Learning, Kriti Singh (Level 4) mentoring Soham in Tableau, Kriti (Level 5) mentoring Soham (Level 3) in Excel, and Soham (Level 3) mentoring Kriti (Level 1) in Docker. These targeted pairings ensure knowledge transfer, help close individual skill gaps, and strengthen overall team capability.
