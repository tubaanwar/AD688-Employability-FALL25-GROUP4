By processing structured skills data, we can uncover patterns about the most in-demand competencies.\n\n\n\n**Data Loading Summary:**\n\nThe dataset contains 59,220 job postings with 56 columns. The analysis identified several skills-related columns including: SKILLS, SKILLS_NAME, SPECIALIZED_SKILLS, SPECIALIZED_SKILLS_NAME, COMMON_SKILLS_NAME, and SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME.\n\n## 1. Data Preparation\n\n### 1.1 Skills Data Overview\n\n\n\n**Skills Processing Summary:**\n\nSuccessfully processed all 59,220 job postings with skills data. The average skills text length is 1,204 characters per posting.\n\n## 2. Keyword Extraction\n\n### 2.1 Top 10 Most Common Skills\n\n::: {#de9ca98b .cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](nlp_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=950 height=567}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Note:** An extreme outlier skill was identified and excluded from the top 10 visualization to provide a more meaningful analysis of the remaining skills distribution.\n\n**Top 10 Skills Insight:**\n\nSAP Applications dominates with 1,114 postings, reflecting the strong demand for enterprise resource planning expertise in large organizations. Oracle Cloud (667) and Microsoft Office (637) follow, showing that cloud platforms and productivity tools remain essential. Communication (532) appears as the top soft skill, emphasizing that technical roles require strong interpersonal abilities. The data reveals a mix of enterprise software (SAP, Oracle Cloud), business analysis capabilities (Data Analysis, Dashboard, Project Management), and emerging areas like Cyber Security and UX Design. Job seekers should prioritize SAP expertise if targeting enterprise roles, while building a foundation in Microsoft Office, data analysis, and communication skills for broader market appeal.\n\n## 3. Technical Skills Analysis\n\n### 3.1 Top 10 Software & Technical Skills\n\n::: {#f4906fe7 .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](nlp_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.png){width=949 height=567}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Top 10 Software Skills - Job Seeker Insights:**\n\nSAP Applications leads dramatically with 934 postings, making it the single most valuable software skill for enterprise-focused careers. Oracle Cloud (633) and Microsoft Office (602) demonstrate the importance of cloud infrastructure and productivity suites. Dashboard skills (433) reflect the growing need for data visualization capabilities across all roles. SQL Programming Language (353) and Microsoft Excel (282) remain fundamental for data manipulation and analysis. The presence of specialized tools like Anaplan (196), Onestream CPM Software (196), and Oracle E-Business Suite (173) indicates niche opportunities in financial planning and enterprise systems. Job seekers should master SAP for enterprise roles, Excel and SQL for data work, and consider specializing in emerging tools like Anaplan for competitive advantage.\n\n## 4. Specialized Skills Analysis\n\n### 4.1 Top 10 Specialized Skills\n\n::: {#bb1f77c9 .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](nlp_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.png){width=950 height=663}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Top 10 Specialized Skills - Job Seeker Insights:**\n\nUser Experience (UX) Design leads with 260 postings, highlighting the critical importance of user-centered design in modern product development. Data Analysis (220) and Cloud Computing (196) show strong demand for analytical and cloud architecture expertise. Emergency Response (143) and Pivot Tables and Charts (125) represent specialized operational and analytical capabilities. SAP Applications (104) appears again, reinforcing its enterprise value. Microsoft Access (89), Databricks (85), Mulesoft (85), and Sales Process (74) round out the list, showing diverse specializations from database management to integration platforms and CRM. Job seekers should prioritize UX design for product roles, data analysis for analytical positions, and cloud computing for infrastructure careers, while considering niche specializations like Databricks or Mulesoft for premium positioning.\n\n## 5. Skill Requirements by Job Title\n\n### 5.1 Skills vs Top Job Titles - Heatmap\n\n::: {#3721e278 .cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](nlp_files/figure-html/cell-7-output-1.png){width=814 height=422}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Skills vs Job Titles - Job Seeker Insights:**\n\nThe heatmap reveals distinct skill patterns across job roles. Unclassified positions show the highest demand for general software skills (37.2% require SAP Applications), suggesting broad technical requirements. Oracle Cloud HCM Consultants have specialized focus with 11.1% requiring Oracle Cloud expertise. Data Governance Analysts need the most diverse skillset with strong SQL Programming Language (13.8%) and moderate requirements across Dashboard, Microsoft Office, and SAP. Enterprise Architects and Solutions Architects show concentrated needs in SAP (10.5% and 8.5% respectively) with minimal other software requirements. Data Modelers uniquely emphasize SQL Programming (2.1%) over other tools. The low percentages overall indicate that most roles don't mandate specific software, creating opportunities for candidates to differentiate through technical mastery. Job seekers should target SAP for enterprise roles, Oracle Cloud for HCM consulting, and SQL for data-focused positions.\n\n## 6. Skill Co-occurrence Analysis\n\n### 6.1 Top 10 Skill Combinations\n\n\n\n**Top 10 Skill Combinations – Summary:**\n\nSkill combinations reveal which competencies employers expect candidates to have together. These pairs show complementary skills that are frequently required in the same job posting. Job seekers should develop these skills in tandem, as having both skills in a pair makes you more attractive to employers. Focus on building skill combinations rather than isolated competencies to maximize your marketability.\n\n## Summary\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n## NLP Analysis Key Findings\n\n*Skills Analysis Results:*\n\n- ✓ Successfully analyzed skills from structured data columns\n- ✓ Identified top 10 most common skills across all job postings\n- ✓ Extracted and ranked top 10 software/technical skills\n- ✓ Analyzed top 10 specialized skills for advanced roles\n- ✓ Cross-referenced skills with job title requirements via heatmap\n- ✓ Discovered top 10 commonly co-occurring skill combinations\n\n*Key Insights:*\n\n- Specific skills dominate the job market across different categories\n- Software skills are critical technical differentiators\n- Specialized skills offer opportunities for premium positioning\n- Skills requirements vary significantly by job title\n- Certain skill pairs frequently appear together, indicating complementary competencies\n\n*Recommendations for Job Seekers:*\n\n- Prioritize learning the top 10 skills identified in each category\n- Develop proficiency in the most demanded software tools\n- Build specialized skills for senior or expert-level opportunities\n- Focus on developing complementary skills that frequently co-occur\n- Use the heatmap to understand skill priorities for your target job titles\n- Tailor your resume to highlight relevant skill combinations\n:::\n\n## References\n\n- Pandas Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/\n- Seaborn Documentation: https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n- Collections Counter: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter\n\n",
