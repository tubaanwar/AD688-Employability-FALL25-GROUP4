## Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of the 2024 job market. We examine hiring trends, employment types, geographic patterns, and remote work opportunities to provide actionable insights for job seekers and market analysts.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import hvplot.pandas
import panel as pn
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Enable panel for rendering
pn.extension()

# Updated color palette - blue, pink, purple, red
COLORS = ['#2196F3', '#E91E63', '#9B59B6', '#F44336', '#00BCD4', '#FF4081', '#7E57C2', '#EF5350']

# Load cleaned data
df = pd.read_csv('cleanedjob_postings.csv')

#print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")
#print(f"Analysis period: 2024 Job Market")
#print(f"Total job postings analyzed: {len(df):,}")
```

## 1. Job Title Analysis

### 1.1 Top In-Demand Job Titles

Understanding which job titles dominate the market helps identify high-demand roles and emerging career opportunities.

```{python}
# Get top 10 job titles 
title_counts = df[df['TITLE_NAME'].notna()]['TITLE_NAME'].value_counts().head(10)
title_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Job Title': title_counts.index, 
    'Count': title_counts.values,
    'Percentage': (title_counts.values / len(df[df['TITLE_NAME'].notna()]) * 100).round(2)
})

print(f"\nTop job titles : {len(title_counts)} titles")

# Create interactive horizontal bar chart
title_df.hvplot.barh(
    x='Job Title',
    y='Count',
    title='Top 10 Most In-Demand Job Titles (2024)',
    height=500,
    width=800,
    color='#2196F3',
    hover_cols=['Percentage'],
    ylabel='',
    xlabel='Number of Job Postings',
    flip_yaxis=True
).opts(xformatter='%.0f')
```

The Top 10 most in-demand jobs are dominated by Data Analyst roles, which appear far more frequently than any other title. Business Intelligence Analysts, Enterprise Architects, and Data Modelers also rank highly, highlighting strong employer demand for data-focused and technical architecture skills. Overall, the top roles show a clear market emphasis on analytics, data management, and solution-oriented positions in 2024.

## 2. Employment Type Distribution

### 2.1 Full-Time vs Part-Time vs Contract

Understanding employment type distribution helps job seekers target positions matching their career preferences.

```{python}
# Count jobs by employment type 
df_employment = df[df['EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME'].notna()].copy()

# Remove "Unknown" values
df_employment = df_employment[df_employment['EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME'] != 'Unknown']

employment_counts = df_employment['EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME'].value_counts()
employment_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Employment Type': employment_counts.index, 
    'Count': employment_counts.values,
    'Percentage': (employment_counts.values / employment_counts.sum() * 100).round(1)
})

#print(f"\nEmployment types : {len(df_employment):,} jobs")
#print(employment_df.to_string(index=False))

# Create bar chart
employment_df.hvplot.bar(
    x='Employment Type',
    y='Count',
    title='Job Market Distribution by Employment Type (2024)',
    height=400,
    width=700,
    color='Employment Type',
    cmap=COLORS,
    hover_cols=['Percentage'],
    ylabel='Number of Job Postings',
    rot=45
).opts(yformatter='%.0f')
```

Most job postings in 2024 require around 5 years of experience, making it the dominant requirement across roles. Entry-level opportunities (0–2 years) exist but are significantly fewer, showing that employers prioritize mid-level talent with proven skills. Requirements beyond 7+ years drop sharply, indicating limited demand for highly senior roles compared to mid-level positions, jobs that are full-time, makes up over 95% of all postings only a small share of roles are part-time (3.3%) or mixed part-time/full-time (1.4%). This shows that employers mainly prefer hiring for stable, full-time positions.

## 3. Remote Work Analysis

### 3.1 Remote vs Hybrid vs On-Site

The prevalence of remote work reflects post-pandemic hiring trends and employer flexibility.

```{python}
# Count jobs by remote type and remove not specified values
df_remote = df.copy()

# Replace None, NaN, Unknown, empty strings with NaN
df_remote['REMOTE_TYPE_NAME'] = df_remote['REMOTE_TYPE_NAME'].replace({
    '[None]': np.nan,
    'None': np.nan,
    'Unknown': np.nan,
    '': np.nan,
    'Not Specified': np.nan
})

# Drop rows with NaN in REMOTE_TYPE_NAME
df_remote = df_remote[df_remote['REMOTE_TYPE_NAME'].notna()]

#print(f"\nRemote type distribution (excluding not specified):")
#print(f"Total jobs with remote info: {len(df_remote):,}")

# Count jobs by remote type
remote_counts = df_remote['REMOTE_TYPE_NAME'].value_counts()
remote_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Remote Type': remote_counts.index,
    'Count': remote_counts.values,
    'Percentage': (remote_counts.values / remote_counts.sum() * 100).round(1)
})

#print(remote_df.to_string(index=False))

# Create bar chart with custom colors
remote_df.hvplot.bar(
    x='Remote Type',
    y='Count',
    title='Job Market Distribution: Remote, Hybrid & On-Site Opportunities (2024)',
    height=400,
    width=700,
    color='Remote Type',
    cmap=['#2196F3', '#E91E63', '#9B59B6', '#F44336'],
    hover_cols=['Percentage'],
    ylabel='Number of Job Postings',
    xlabel='Work Location Type',
    rot=0
).opts(yformatter='%.0f')
```

The dominance of full-time roles in 2024 reflects a strong post-COVID recovery, as companies shift back toward stable, long-term hiring after years of uncertainty. The very small share of part-time and hybrid hour roles suggests that businesses are prioritizing consistent workforce availability to meet rising operational demands. Overall, the trend indicates increased employer confidence and a return to pre-pandemic hiring patterns focused on full-time talent.

## 4. Geographic Analysis

### 4.1 Top States for Job Opportunities

Geographic distribution shows where job opportunities are concentrated.

```{python}
# Get top 10 states by job postings 
df_states = df[df['STATE_NAME'].notna()].copy()

state_counts = df_states['STATE_NAME'].value_counts().head(10)
state_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'State': state_counts.index,
    'Job Postings': state_counts.values,
    'Percentage': (state_counts.values / len(df_states) * 100).round(2)
})

#print(f"\nStates with job postings : {len(df_states):,} jobs")

# Create bar chart
state_df.hvplot.bar(
    x='State',
    y='Job Postings',
    title='Top 10 States by Number of Job Postings (2024)',
    height=450,
    width=850,
    color='#9B59B6',
    hover_cols=['Percentage'],
    ylabel='Number of Job Postings',
    xlabel='State',
    rot=45
).opts(yformatter='%.0f')
```

The top 10 states for job postings in 2024 are led by Texas and California, which together dominate the job market with substantially higher opportunities than the rest. States like Virginia, Florida, New York, and Illinois follow, reflecting strong demand in both tech-heavy and fast-growing regional economies. Overall, job opportunities are concentrated in major economic hubs and states with strong corporate, technology, and government sectors.

## 5. Top Hiring Companies

### 5.1 Companies with Most Job Openings

Identifying top hiring companies helps job seekers target organizations with multiple opportunities.

```{python}
# Get top 10 companies by job postings (remove None values)
df_companies = df[df['COMPANY_NAME'].notna()].copy()

company_counts = df_companies['COMPANY_NAME'].value_counts().head(10)
company_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Company': company_counts.index,
    'Job Postings': company_counts.values
})

#print(f"\nCompanies with job postings : {len(df_companies):,} jobs")

# Create horizontal bar chart
company_df.hvplot.barh(
    x='Company',
    y='Job Postings',
    title='Top 10 Companies by Number of Job Postings (2024)',
    height=550,
    width=800,
    color='#E91E63',
    ylabel='',
    xlabel='Number of Job Postings',
    flip_yaxis=True
).opts(xformatter='%.0f')
```

The Top 10 hiring companies in 2024 are led by Deloitte and Accenture, which show significantly higher job postings than other firms,reflecting strong demand for consulting, technology, and analytics roles. Companies like PwC, Insight Global, KPMG, and Lumen Technologies also appear prominently, indicating consistent hiring across both consulting and IT services sectors. Overall, the hiring landscape is dominated by large professional services firms, showcasing continued growth in advisory, digital transformation, and data-driven business roles.

## 6. Job Posting Timeline

### 6.1 When Jobs Are Posted

Understanding posting patterns helps with strategic job search timing.
Since job postings peaked in August and September 2024, job seekers should target this late-summer period for applications. Companies appear to increase hiring toward the end of Q3, meaning more openings, faster responses, and higher chances of landing interviews. Preparing resumes, portfolios, and applications ahead of this surge (during May–July) can give job seekers a strategic advantage when the market becomes most active.

```{python}
# Print diagnostics
#print("\nAnalyzing POSTED column:")
#print(f"Sample values: {df['POSTED'].head(10)}")
#print(f"Data type: {df['POSTED'].dtype}")

# Convert POSTED to datetime
df_time = df.copy()
df_time['POSTED'] = pd.to_datetime(df_time['POSTED'], errors='coerce')

#print(f"\nAfter conversion:")
#print(f"Date range: {df_time['POSTED'].min()} to {df_time['POSTED'].max()}")
#print(f"Valid dates: {df_time['POSTED'].notna().sum():,} out of {len(df_time):,}")
#print(f"Missing dates: {df_time['POSTED'].isna().sum():,}")

# Filter valid dates
time_data = df_time[df_time['POSTED'].notna()].copy()

if len(time_data) > 0:
    # Extract year-month
    time_data['YearMonth'] = time_data['POSTED'].dt.to_period('M')
    
    # Group by month and count
    monthly_counts = time_data.groupby('YearMonth').size().reset_index(name='Job Postings')
    monthly_counts['Month'] = monthly_counts['YearMonth'].astype(str)
    
    # Sort by month
    monthly_counts = monthly_counts.sort_values('Month')
    
    #print(f"\nMonthly posting counts:")
    #print(monthly_counts[['Month', 'Job Postings']].to_string(index=False))
    
    # Create line and area chart
    line_chart = monthly_counts.hvplot.line(
        x='Month',
        y='Job Postings',
        title='Job Posting Trends Over Time (2024)',
        height=400,
        width=850,
        color='#2196F3',
        line_width=3,
        ylabel='Number of Job Postings',
        xlabel='Month',
        rot=45
    ).opts(yformatter='%.0f')
    
    area_chart = monthly_counts.hvplot.area(
        x='Month',
        y='Job Postings',
        alpha=0.3,
        color='#2196F3'
    )
    
    # Combine line and area
    (line_chart * area_chart)
else:
    #print("\nWarning: No valid dates found in POSTED column")
    ##print("Sample of POSTED values:")
    print(df['POSTED'].head(20))
```


## 7. Experience Requirements

### 7.1 Minimum Years of Experience Required

Understanding experience requirements helps assess job market accessibility.

```{python}
# Analyze minimum years of experience (remove None values)
df_experience = df[df['MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE'].notna()].copy()

exp_counts = df_experience['MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE'].value_counts().sort_index()
exp_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Years of Experience': exp_counts.index,
    'Job Postings': exp_counts.values
})

# Convert Years of Experience to string for better labels
exp_df['Years Label'] = exp_df['Years of Experience'].astype(int).astype(str) + ' years'

#print(f"\nJobs with experience requirements (excluding None): {len(df_experience):,} jobs")
#print(exp_df[['Years of Experience', 'Job Postings']].to_string(index=False))

# Create bar chart with pastel purple color
exp_df.hvplot.bar(
    x='Years Label',
    y='Job Postings',
    title='Job Postings by Minimum Years of Experience Required (2024)',
    height=400,
    width=800,
    color='#B39DDB',
    ylabel='Number of Job Postings',
    xlabel='Minimum Years of Experience',
    rot=45
).opts(yformatter='%.0f')
```

Most job postings in 2024 require around 5 years of experience, making it the dominant requirement across roles. Entry-level opportunities (0–2 years) exist but are significantly fewer, showing that employers prioritize mid-level talent with proven skills. Requirements beyond 7+ years drop sharply, indicating limited demand for highly senior roles compared to mid-level positions.
